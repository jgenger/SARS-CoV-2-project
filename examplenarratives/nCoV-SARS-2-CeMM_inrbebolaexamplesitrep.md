abstract: "This genomic epidemiology situation report describes transmission chain movement between Katwa and Mandima, as well as clusters in Kayna and Kalunguta. The most recent genomes described in this report were sequenced on Sept 06, 2019. All inferences are based on the extent of sequencing conducted at the point of writing (currently ~12% of cases). As in any genomic epi study, sequencing of additional cases could change some inferences of transmission. Please note this is an example situation report, thus all genomic identifiers shown here are lab IDs that are NOT linked to epidemiologic metadata. All sequences discussed here have been released publicly."

# [Transmission chain movement between Katwa and Mandima](https://nextstrain.org/ebola/inrb-drc/2019-09-14-no-epi-id?clade=c19&f_health_zone=Katwa,Mandima&d=tree,map)

In the late fall of 2018 there were multiple separate transmission chains circulating in Katwa. One of these transmission chains, defined by viruses grouping together within clade c19, circulated in Katwa from at least October 2018 to January 2019. That transmission chain moved from Katwa into Mandima in early January 2019, as indicated by the introduction timing of clade c18, and circulated in Mandima until at least early April 2019. That same transmission chain then moved back into Katwa in early April 2019, although with seemlingly limited onward transmission.

# [New sequences from transmission cluster in Kayna](https://nextstrain.org/ebola/inrb-drc/2019-09-14-no-epi-id?clade=c26&f_health_zone=Kayna&d=tree)

Three newly sequenced cases, lab-BTB24232, lab-BTB23817, and lab-BTB24057, all from Kayna, share a common mutation and group together in cluster c28. We infer that the common ancestor of these cases existed around 2 weeks prior to their detection, and that the mutation that characterizes this cluster occurred in late July or early August of 2019. This indicates that these cases are likely closely linked. The source case of these three infections indicated by the contact tracing data was not sequenced, thus we are unable to confirm the source attribution at this time. A fourth case from Kayna, lab-BTB20594, does not cluster within c28. Given that lab-BTB20594 has an earlier sampling date and lacks the common mutation shared by cases in cluster c28, lab-BTB20594 was likely infected prior to the other three cases. It is possible that lab-BTB20594 could be an earlier case in the same transmission chain as lab-BTB24232, lab-BTB23817, and lab-BTB24057, although we would need more genomic data and verification with contact tracing histories to be sure.

# [Multiple co-circulating transmission chains in Kalunguta.](https://nextstrain.org/ebola/inrb-drc/2019-09-14-no-epi-id?clade=c33&f_health_zone=Kalunguta&d=tree)

Here we show seven new sequences from cases in Kalunguta. These cases are lab-BTB24630, lab-BTB22982, lab-BTB24909, lab-BTB24518, lab-BTB24923, lab-KAT10686, and lab-BTB22852. Despite the fact that all of these case were sampled in Kalunguta, they are genetically diverse, and cluster into three separate groups. Lab-BTB24630, lab-BTB22982, lab-BTB24909, and lab-BTB24518 group together with lab-BTB22334 within cluster c31. Given that lab-BTB22334 is the least genetically diverged of the Kalunguta samples, it could be the source case in this transmission cluster. This agrees with contact tracing data indicating that lab-BTB22334 is the source case for lab-BTB22982. We do not have sequences from any of the other source cases indicated in the contact tracing data, and therefore cannot confirm the other hypothesized links.

# [Multiple co-circulating transmission chains in Kalunguta.](https://nextstrain.org/ebola/inrb-drc/2019-09-14-no-epi-id?clade=c33&f_health_zone=Kalunguta&d=tree)

lab-BTB24923 and lab-KAT10686 cluster together within c32, and are genetically diverged from cases in cluster c31 even though the cases were sampled at roughly the same time. The genomic data therefore indicate that lab-BTB24923 and lab-KAT10686 represent a separate transmission chain from the cases in c31. The last newly sequenced case, lab-BTB22852, has a genome that is quite diverged from the other Kalunguta cases, and groups within cluster c30. This indicates that lab-BTB22852 is unrelated to the other newly sequenced cases discussed here. When putting the genomic data together with the sampling date of the cases, **we find evidence of at least three distinct clusters of transmission that are co-circulating in Kalunguta.**
