abstract: "This project was launched on 27 March 2020 by CeMM in close collaboration with the Medical University of Vienna. 

The project aims at sequencing 1,000 viral genomes obtained from Austrian patient-derived samples, in order to learn more about the molecular understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and the causative pathogen. The project results will integrate Austrian viral genome data into a global map of SARS-CoV-2 mutations, which will help decipher the mutational dynamics underlying the COVID-19 pandemic."

# [Tracking SARS-CoV-2](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/nCoV-SARS-2-CeMM/subsampled/8000?animate=2019-12-19,2020-04-24,0,0,15000&d=map&r=region&c=region)

* The first cases of COVID-19 were described in December 2019[3]. Since then, SARS-CoV-2 spread first to different provinces in China and could eventually establish outbreaks in countries all over the world.

* Sequencing the genomes of viruses isolated from infected patients helps us to understand the evolution of the virus. Moreover, mutations in the viral genome that occur during the spread of SARS-CoV-2 can be used like barcodes to identify connections between different infection clusters and to infer transmission lines.

* Until today, CeMM sequenced viral genomes from 21 Austrian patients. In the following analysis, we compared these samples with 8343 viral genomes from 59 countries on all continents.

# [Phylogenetic analysis reveals an early branching event in SARS-CoV-2 evolution](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/nCoV-SARS-2-CeMM/subsampled/8000?c=gt-S_614&d=tree,entropy)

* The analysis of mutational signatures in the SARS-CoV-2 genome revealed a major branch point in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny. 
* Based on our sequence analysis, we conclude that this branching event occured already in the early stages of the pandemic in January 2020 and bases on a mutation in codon 614 of the S protein. 
* The viral S protein interacts with ACE2 surface proteins on target cells and mediates viral entry into the cell. However, it is not clear whether this S D614G mutation has an effect on the function of the S protein.

# [The S D614G mutation is dominant in the early European infection clusters](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/nCoV-SARS-2-CeMM/subsampled/8000?c=gt-S_614&dmax=2020-02-24&dmin=2020-01-11&d=map&s=Germany/BavPat1/2020)

* However, thanks to SARS-CoV-2 sequencing projects all over the world, we can trace the S D614G back to its origin and learn how the virus spreads. 
* Our preliminary data suggest that the first two occurences of the D614G mutation in the United Kingdom and Germany on the 22nd and 28th of January were connected to transmissions from China.

* We estimate that these two introduction events led quickly to local outbreaks in France, Belgium, Italy, Denmark, Iceland, Russia, Turkey and also Austria.
* In the following weeks, viruses with the S D614G mutation appeared all over Europe and established as the dominant strains in many European countries.
* Moreover, sequence analysis suggests further transmission of this strain to North America and subsequent reintroduction events from the USA to many European countries.

# [Connection of local outbreaks in Austria and other European outbreaks](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/nCoV-SARS-2-CeMM/subsampled/8000?c=gt-S_614&f_country=Austria&d=tree)

This observation is in line with the results from our mutational analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains from Austrian patients. Most of the patient samples from Austrian patients show the same S D614G mutation shared by many other European strains.

# [Connection of local outbreaks in Austria and other European outbreaks](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/nCoV-SARS-2-CeMM/subsampled/8000?f_country=Austria&d=map&r=location)

* A reconstruction of the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny based on our sequencing data allowed us to infer some transmission lines that led to the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to Austria. 
* Based on this analysis, we estimate introduction events connected to outbreaks in the United Kingdom, Spain, Iceland, France, and Italy.

# [Outlook: Focus on Austria](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/nCoV-SARS-2-CeMM/subsampled/8000?c=division&f_country=Austria&d=tree,map&r=division)

Together with its collaborators all over Austria, CeMM will keep sequencing SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Austrian patients in order to understand how the virus spread to, within and from Austria and in order to provide the research community with insights into the mutational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.
