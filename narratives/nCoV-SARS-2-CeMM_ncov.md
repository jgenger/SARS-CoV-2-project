abstract: "This project was launched on 27 March 2020 by CeMM in close collaboration with the Medical University of Vienna. 

The project aims at sequencing 1,000 viral genomes obtained from Austrian patient-derived samples, in order to learn more about the molecular understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and the causative pathogen. The project results will integrate Austrian viral genome data into a global map of SARS-CoV-2 mutations, which will help decipher the mutational dynamics underlying the COVID-19 pandemic."

# [Tracking SARS-CoV-2](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/nCoV-SARS-2-CeMM/ncov?animate=2019-12-19,2020-04-24,0,0,15000&d=map&r=region&c=region)

The first cases of COVID-19 were described in December 2019[2]. Since then, SARS-CoV-2 spread first to different provinces in China and could eventually establish outbreaks in countries all over the world.

Sequencing the genomes of viruses isolated from infected patients helps us to understand the evolution of the virus. Moreover, mutations in the viral genome that occur during the spread of SARS-CoV-2 can be used like barcodes to identify connections between different infection clusters and to infer transmission lines.

Until today, CeMM sequenced viral genomes from 21 Austrian patients. In the following analysis, we compared these samples with 8343 viral genomes from 59 countries on all continents. 

# [Phylogenetic analysis reveals an early branching event in SARS-CoV-2 evolution](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/nCoV-SARS-2-CeMM/ncov?c=gt-S_614&d=tree,entropy)

The analysis of mutational signatures in the SARS-CoV-2 genome revealed a major branch point in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny. This branching event occured already in the early stages of the pandemic in January 2020 and bases on a mutation in codon 614 of the S protein. 

The the viral S protein interacts with ACE2 surface proteins on target cells and mediates viral entry into the cell. However, it is not clear whether this S D23043G mutation has an effect on the function of the S protein.

# [The S D23043G mutation is dominant in the early European infection clusters](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/nCoV-SARS-2-CeMM/ncov?c=gt-S_614&dmax=2020-02-24&dmin=2020-01-11&d=map&s=Germany/BavPat1/2020)

However, thanks to virus sequencing efforts all over the world, we can trace the S D23043G back to its origin and learn how the virus spreads. The S The first two occurences of the D23043G mutation were connected to transmissions from China to the United Kingdom and Germany on the 22nd and 28th of January, respectively.

These two introduction events lead quickly to local outbreaks in France, Belgium, Italy, Denmark, Iceland, Russia, Turkey and also Austria. In the following weeks, viruses originating from these two introduction events spread all over Europe and established as the dominant strains in many European countries. Moreover, we can observe further transmission of this strain to the USA and a subsequent reintroduction of the strain from the USA to many European countries.

# [Local outbreaks in Austria are closely connected to other European outbreaks](https://nextstrain.org/community/jgenger/nCoV-SARS-2-CeMM/ncov?c=gt-S_614&f_country=Austria&d=tree)

This observation is in line with the results from our mutational analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains from Austrian patients. Most of the patient samples from Austrian patients show the same S D23043G mutation shared by many other European strains.

A reconstruction of the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny based on our sequencing data allowed us to infer the transmission lines that led to the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to Austria. We were able to identify introduction events connected from the United Kingdom, Spain, Iceland, France, and Italy.
