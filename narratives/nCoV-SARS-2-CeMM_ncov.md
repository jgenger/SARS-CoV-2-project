abstract: "This project was launched on 27 March 2020 by CeMM in close collaboration with the Medical University of Vienna. 

The project aims at sequencing 1,000 viral genomes obtained from Austrian patient-derived samples, in order to learn more about the molecular understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and the causative pathogen. The project results will integrate Austrian viral genome data into a global map of SARS-CoV-2 mutations, which will help decipher the mutational dynamics underlying the COVID-19 pandemic."

The first cases of COVID-19 were described in December $$2019^2$$. Since then, SARS-CoV-2 spread first to different provinces in China and could then even establish outbreaks in countries all over the world.\
\
Sequencing the genomes of viruses isolated from infected patients can help us to understand the evolution of the virus. Mutations in the viral genome that occur during the spread of SARS-CoV-2 can be used like barcodes to identify connections to foreign infection clusters and to infer transmission lines.\
\
Until today, CeMM sequenced viral genomes from 21 Austrian patients. In the following analysis, we compared these samples with more than 8000 viral genomes from 59 countries on 5 continents.

Analysis of mutational signatures revealed that the establishment of the first infection clusters in Europe correlates with a major branching event in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny.
